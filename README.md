## Executive Summary
The objective of this work is to understand the Customer Purchasing Behavior through apriori algorithm for association rule mining with the help of key metrics.

#### How does this be of help to decision makers?

•	Product Recommendation
•	Store Layout plannning
• Cross-Selling Strategies
•	Pricing & Sales Strategies

#### Key Metrics used

1. Support-The fraction of transactions that contain both X and Y items. Tells how frequently the rule occurs in the dataset.

2. Confidence- The fraction of transactions containing X, that also contain Y. Tells how frequently items in Y appear in transactions that contain X.

3. Lift- The ratio of the observed support to that expected if X and Y were independent. Values greater than 1 indicate that the rule occurs more often than expected.


#### Potential metrics could also be used 
1. Zhang Metric- Accounts for both the support and confidence of the rule. Tends to filter out rules with medium support and high confidence only.

2. Leverage- Measures the difference between the observed and expected frequencies, standardized by the standard deviations. Can identify rules more surprising to the data.

#### Tech Stacks: Power Query, Power BI
